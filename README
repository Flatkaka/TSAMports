PROJECT 2, TSAM
------------------------------------------------------------------

This is our code solution to project 2, scanner.cpp, port2.cpp amd
port3.cpp

------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run the code.
------------------------------------------------------------------

To comepile the scanner.cpp, part2.cpp and part3.cpp write "make" into the 
commandline

        make

To run the scanner write following command. Scanner takes in 3 attribute
the Ip address you want to scan and then the next 2 attriputes are 
the ports where you want to scan, The lower port should be the first one.
For this project lower port should be 4000 and the higer on 4100.

        ./scanner <dest_IP_address> <lowert_portnr> <higer_portnr>

Then in to run part2 you need to write the following command.
where it takes in 5 attriputes. First destIP address that the server is running on 
then the source ip address you are sending from. 
Then there you have to enter the three portnumbers that the scanner showed that are open
do not include the port 4042 that is for part3. Finally the port 
numbers have to be increasing order.

        sudo ./part2 <dest_IP_address> <sorce_IP_address> <portnr1> <portnr2> <portnr3>

To run part3 you need to write the following command.
where it takes in 5 attriputes. First destIP address that the server is running on 
then the source ip address you are sending from. Then the three ports, first the
orcale port, (wich is allways 4042). then the twho secret port that the part2
said were the secret ports. 
You should enter first the lower secert port number then the higer.

        sudo ./part3 <dest_IP_address> <soruce_IP_address> <oracle_port> <port_low> <port_hig>
